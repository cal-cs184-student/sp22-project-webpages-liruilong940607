        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

        <!-- Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. 
        Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what 
        interesting things you've learned from completing the project. -->
        <p>
            In this first assignment, I get familiar with how the vector format data 
            (e.g. SVG images) is being drawn to the screen. It is superisingly 
            interesting that the underlying representation of SVG images are actually
            a bunch of triangles with colors or texture maps, similar to the 3D meshes. 
            This assignment helps me to reveal the mystery on why some SVG images can 
            be "infinite resolution" -- it's just rasterization of the colored triangles!
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides, through the implementation of sub-pixel sampling, multi-level mipmaps
            texture mapping etc, I get the chance to closely feel the visual differences
            on the screen, with different underlying technologies. Really devil is in the
            detail! A slight change could lead to a huge improvment towards visual pleasing. 
            And like wise, a tiny bug could also cause unimaginable "art" results!
        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

        <!-- 
        Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.
        
        Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within 
        the bounding box of the triangle.

        Show a png screenshot of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters 
        and with the pixel inspector centered on an interesting part of the scene.

        Extra credit: Explain any special optimizations you did beyond simple bounding 
        box triangle rasterization, with a timing comparison table (we suggest using 
        the c++ clock() function around the svg.draw() command in DrawRend::redraw() 
        to compare millisecond timings with your various optimizations off and on).

        <p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. 
            Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. 
            You might find this useful for framing and showing your result 
            images in an organized fashion.</p>
