        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

        <!-- Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. 
        Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what 
        interesting things you've learned from completing the project. -->
        <p>
            In this first assignment, I get familiar with how the vector format data 
            (e.g. SVG images) is being drawn to the screen. It is superisingly 
            interesting that the underlying representation of SVG images are actually
            a bunch of triangles with colors or texture maps, similar to the 3D meshes. 
            This assignment helps me to reveal the mystery on why some SVG images can 
            be "infinite resolution" -- it's just rasterization of the colored triangles!
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides, through the implementation of sub-pixel sampling, multi-level mipmaps
            texture mapping etc, I get the chance to closely feel the visual differences
            on the screen, with different underlying technologies. Really devil is in the
            detail! A slight change could lead to a huge improvment towards visual pleasing. 
            And like wise, a tiny bug could also cause unimaginable "art" results!
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>
		
		<!-- Task 1 -->
        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
		
		<p><b>I. Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
			For the SVG images, the rasterization process is to get the color 
			of all pixels covered by a specific triangle. We can process each
			triangle seperately because there are no occlusions across triangles
			for SVG images, unlike 3D meshes. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Implementation wise, we need to 
			conduct the three-line test for each pixel to decide whether it is 
			within a specific triangle. If it is inside, then the pixel color can
			be accquire from the triangle, otherwise, we can safely skip this pixel,
			and let other traingles to decide its color.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p><b>
			II. Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks 
			each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.
		</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In my implementation, I just forloop all the samples inside the bounding box.</p>
		</blockquote>
			
		<p><b>
			III. Show a <em>png</em> screenshot of <em>basic/test4.svg</em> with the 
			default viewing parameters and with the pixel inspector centered on 
			an interesting part of the scene.

		<!-- Task 2 -->
        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

		<p><b>I. Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. 
			Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you make to the 
			rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling 
			to antialias your triangles.
		</b></p>
		<blockquote><p>
			The idea behind the supersampling method for antialiasing, is to smooth the
			edge of the traingles, by locally averaging color on the edge. A 
			straight-forward way to do this is to split each sample into multiple sub-samples
			around it and calculate the color by averaging all those sub-samples. Implementation
			wise, we have to host a buffer that has a larger resolution than the actual image,
			for those sub-samples. Then after the rasterization, a simple averaging on on the 
			sub-samples give you the final color for all the samples. 
		</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>II. Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing 
			parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them side-by-side. 
			Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect 
			dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner. Explain 
			why these results are observed.

		<p><b>Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image 
			to aid you in your explanation. One idea is to use a svg file that plots 
			a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, which 
			should produce a smoothly blended color triangle.
		</b></p>
		<blockquote><p>
			The barycentric coordinates of a point p represents how close this p to each
			vertex of the triangle. The more close, the more it would be affected by that 
			perticular vertex. So the attributes of the point p can be generally interpolated
			with barycentric coordinates on the attributes of the vertices. Implementation wise,
			the barycentric coordinates equal to the area of the three sub-triangles divided by the
			point p.

		<!-- Task 5 -->
        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

		<p><b>Explain pixel sampling in your own words and describe how you 
			implemented it to perform texture mapping. Briefly discuss the two 
			different pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear.
		</b></p>

		<blockquote><p>
			Given a texture image, and the uv coordinates of the three triangle
			vertices, the color of a sample inside the triangle, can be sampled 
			from the texture image using its barycentric interpolated uv coordinate.
			Since the barycentric uv might not be integers, while the pixel coordinates
			on the texutre image are integers, we could have different options on 
			the sampling. The nearest way just finds the nearest integers for the uv. While 
			the bilinear way finds the four surrounding pixels for each sample and
			interpolates the color based on distance.
		</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>Check out the svg files in the svg/texmap/ directory. Use the pixel 
			inspector to find a good example of where bilinear sampling clearly 
			defeats nearest sampling. Show and compare four png screenshots using 
			nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples 
			per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and bilinear 
			sampling at 16 samples per pixel.

		<p><b>Comment on the relative differences. Discuss when there will be a large 
			difference between the two methods and why.
		</b></p>

		<blockquote><p>
			The above images show a large difference on thin edges. When the texture map 
			has high frequency details like thin edges, nearest sampling could easily give 
			you a color that is totally different than what you want. On the contrary, bilinear
			sampling on the texture map gives you an averaging color consider its surrounding,
			reduce the peak error of the color.
		</p></blockquote>


        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

		<p><b>Explain level sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented 
			it for texture mapping.</b></p>
	
		<blockquote><p>
			The idea of level sampling is that for the "smooth" regions, you would want to 
			sample color on a low-res texture image for antialiasing. For the "sharp" regions,
			you would want to sample color on a high-res texture image for clearness. Thus 
			implementation wise we buffer a pyramid of texture images. For each sample, we decide
			which level of pyramid it should sample color from, by looking at its uv gradients.
			We have options of nearest or linear interpolation between levels since the level we 
			calculated from its uv gradients could be float value instead of a integer.
		</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>You can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, 
			level sampling, or the number of samples per pixel. Describe the tradeoffs 
			between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three 
			various techniques.</b></p>
		
		<blockquote><p>
			Increasing the number of samples per pixel causes a huge memory usage increase,
			speed decrease. And it's effecive globally on all pixels.
			Selecting pixel sampling and level sampling mode does not increase memory usage,
			with slight speed decrease. The former one has affect globally on all images, 
			whereas the latter one has only antialiasing affect on the regions that are supposed
			to be smooth.
		</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>Using a png file you find yourself, show us four versions of the image, 
			using the combinations of L_ZERO and P_NEAREST, L_ZERO and P_LINEAR, L_NEAREST 
			and P_NEAREST, as well as L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR.</b></p>
